# Industrial Temperature Monitoring System With LCD

## Project Overview
This project is an Arduino-based industrial temperature monitoring system with a 16x2 LCD display and alarm mechanism.

## Problem Statement
Overheating in industrial environments can damage equipment and cause operational downtime.

## System Features
- Real-time temperature display on LCD
- Alarm activation when threshold exceeds
- Simple Human-Machine Interface (HMI) concept

## Hardware Components
- Arduino UNO
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Buzzer

## Working Logic
1. Read temperature sensor
2. Convert analog value
3. Display temperature on LCD
4. Activate alarm if threshold exceeds

## Future Scope
- IoT remote monitoring
- Cloud data logging
- SMS alert system
